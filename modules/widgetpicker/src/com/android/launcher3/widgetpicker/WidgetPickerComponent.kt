import dagger.Subcomponent

/**
 * A sub-component that apps can include in their dagger module to bootstrap & interact with apis
 * provided by widget picker.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Include this component as a sub-component on your app's main dagger module (and remember to
 *    update Android.bp & gradle files).
 * 2. Ensure bindings necessary for repository interfaces used in [WidgetPickerModule] are provided
 *    in your app.
 * 3. Host a singleton class in your app to create an instance of widget picker component on-demand
 *    e.g. when user wants to open widget picker.
 *
 * Example for #3.
 *
 * ```
 * @MyAppSingleton
 * public class WidgetPickerProvider {
 *     private final Provider<WidgetPickerComponent.Factory> widgetPickerComponentProvider;
 *
 *     @Inject
 *     public WidgetPickerProvider(Provider<WidgetPickerComponent.Factory> widgetPickerComponentProvider) {
 *         this.widgetPickerComponentProvider = widgetPickerComponentProvider;
 *     }
 *
 *     public boolean show(...) {
 *         WidgetPickerComponent component = widgetPickerComponentProvider.get().build();
 *         WidgetPickerUiInteractor interactor = component.getWidgetInteractor();
 *         return interactor.show(...);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
