Lawnchair 16 Development 1 is here! Contributors are encouraged to target this branch instead of
older (i.e., Lawnchair `15-dev`).

### 🥞 Development 1

First development milestone! Basic launcher functionality should be stable enough.

* Make basic features of Launcher work (App Drawer, Home Screen, Search, Folders, Widgets)
* Enable Material Expressive Flags (Try swiping through launcher page)
* Enable All Apps Blur Flags (Try opening All Apps on supported devices)

* Make Predictive Back Gesture work on Android 13, 14, 15, 16 (Try swiping left or right on gesture-based navigational)
* Programmatically set Safe Mode status

#### Known Bugs

* App Icon may sometimes render with less than 0 in height/width causing blank icon to be rendered and crashing ISE on customising icons
* Any Lawnchair settings using IDP will crash the launcher
* Icon pack isn't usable
* Dynamic icons will not be themed by launcher
