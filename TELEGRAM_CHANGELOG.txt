Hey everyone, and happy holidays from the Lawnchair team! 🎄

We're excited to announce that Lawnchair 15 Beta 2 is now available for download!

This release contains several bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements that make the Lawnchair 15 experience much more stable and enjoyable. Some of the highlights include:

- A completely revamped search experience
- Infinite home screen scrolling
- The ability to reorder apps inside app drawer folders
- ...and many more fixes for crashes and visual bugs!

A huge thank you to everyone who made this release possible: our code contributors on GitHub, our translators on Crowdin, and our financial supporters on Open Collective. Your support is what keeps this project going.

We'll have a full Lawnstate blog post coming soon with a look back at the year and a deep dive into the ongoing work for Lawnchair 16.

For now, enjoy a more stable home screen for the holidays!
